My project is a commandline calculator which is arbitrary precision. 
It does basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division for arbitrary precision floating point numbers and power 
operation only for arbitrary precision integers. 
It also evaluates functions like sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, cosec,ln, log 
for non arbitrary presision floating point numbers.
It has a feature called base using which we can do basic basic calculations 
with base from 2 to 16. 
It also has a feature to assign variables. 
It also as a feature for scale which outputs the answer with decimal 
precision given by the user.
